1.  Question Weight(Wq) - Will be dynamic 
1.  Answer Weight(Wa)

(note: Adding weights to both question and options will be manually done. Many data labeling tasks are done like this and thus this can not be any hindrance.)

Parameters:



1.  Rational Thinking
1.  Spirit of Inquiry
1.  Causality (Cause-Effect relationship)
1.  Scientific Information

**Day 1's AIM**: To give a basic/starter question.



1.  What is the shape of the earth? (Sci-info)
    1.  Spherical
    1.  Cubical 
    1.  Flat (with edges)
    1.  Ellipsoid 
        1.  Directions: 
            1.  Options are self-explanatory. When we say spherical -> perfect sphere. When ellipsoid -> orange like/flat on top shape
            1.  Ellipsoid > spherical >> Flat >> Cubical

       2)  A restaurant - 5 tables - 2 person each table - 10 forks - 10 spoons - 9 knife(1 knife is missing in front of a lady)  - one man left dead in gents toilet - a knife in front of him with blood - who is the killer? (Rational Thinking) 

      3) Choose one: (Spirit of inquiry)



1.  Hometown
1.  Job town
1.  Far off land
1.  MARS

	Idea Behind this: If one chooses far off land or MARS one can be scored high on Spirit of Inquiry. If one chooses MARS he sure is an explorer but not very practical. Hometown shows that the individual is not very exploratory. 

Drawback is : One can perceive this problem statement differently

So alternate Idea:

Choose one:



1.  Mountain Range
1.  Beach
1.  Lake side
1.  Lounge/Home

Giving just one option of more convenience one who chooses option d tend to have less spirit of inquiry. (exploration)

4) Event one : House on fire (Causality) 

    Event two: Bill(Fire fighter) died



1.  CO poisoning 
1.  Burnt
1.  Under Wreck

Idea : two events as stated are related and that relationship is given by the options. CO poisoning > Burnt > Under Wreck

Because : The image of dead Bill has its clothes intact. So it must be CO poisoning. Burnt next cz it is related to heat but since his clothes are intact he is not directly burnt. Under Wreck is the last option cz obvio image me dikh raha hai.
